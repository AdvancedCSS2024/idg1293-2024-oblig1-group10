# Oblig in IDG1293

We started by drawing the up the different components that you find in our version of the two screenshots.


## page-screenshot1.html - Håkon

Håkon started by creating the layout for the page "page-screenshot1.html".
I first started on the top, and worked my way down. I tried to commit and sync my changes each time i was working on the project. I ran into some problems because i work on two separate computers, but eventually things worked out. 
For the grid items, i copyed the SVG code from FINN's site. It was an big challenge to get the icons to change color from blue to gray when hovered. Eventually, it worked with color. e.g. the car. Very nice "refreshing" my grid knowledge.. 

 The cards went pretty fine, and i had a pretty good idea of how i wanted to make them. Some difficulties came up, escpecially the "heart" button in the top right corner. 

## page-screenshot2.html - Lauritz

Lauritz, when making the html for the screenshot2 page, started with making the layout of the card and seperating the different elements in their own divs, implementing the BEM namings from the start. This laid a strong foundation, ensuring a clean, modular structure. He followed BEM conventions for class names, which makes the CSS easier to understand and maintain. Each piece of the card, like buttons and inputs, got its own BEM class, like login-card__button for the login button. This approach is great for teamwork and future updates.





## Demo page


Lastly, we created the demo.html page together, and implememted our cool features we used on the screenshots. The teamwork within the group has worked very well, and we have learned a lot during this oblig.
